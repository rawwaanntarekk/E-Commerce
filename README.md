Built a complete online shopping app using React.js, a popular web development tool. To make sure everything works smoothly, I used these helpful libraries:

Validation: Formik and Yup double-check information entered by users to avoid mistakes.
Data: Axios helps the app talk to other programs, and Context APIs share information easily between different parts of the app.
Fetching & Caching: React Query gets information from the web and stores it for faster use later.
Styling: Bootstrap and Sass make the app look good and keep it consistent.
Navigation: React Router DOM lets users move around the app without refreshing the whole page.
The app allows users to:

Shop: Add, remove, and change items in their shopping cart.
Pay: Choose online payment or cash on delivery.
Wishlist: Create and manage lists of items they want to buy later.
More Features: There are probably even more cool things the app can do!
